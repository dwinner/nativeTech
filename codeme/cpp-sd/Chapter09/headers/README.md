## Chapter 9: The Future of C++ Code Reuse: Using Modules

### Prerequisites

Install the following software:

- CMake 3.28
- Conan 2
- GCC 15, Clang 20, MSVC 19.50

The C++ compiler in your IDE and the Conan profile must be compatible to compile examples from the IDE.

Assuming you're on Linux or using WSL. The examples are developed on Linux, but their compilation and
functionality are also tested on macOS and Windows.

Configure a local Conan profile and remotes by running:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/
conan profile detect --name ./build/conan_profile
```

Make sure that the profile section `[settings]` contains:

```text
arch=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=15
os=Linux
```

### Building

To build the project, configure the Conan profile as described above, cd to its directory, and then run:

```bash
conan install . --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./build/conan_profile
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

If GCC 15 is not your default compiler, you can tell CMake to use it with the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flag:

```bash
conan install . --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./build/conan_profile
cmake --preset conan-release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which g++-15`
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

To pass the settings directly without a Conan profile, use the command line option `--settings:all` or `-s:a`, and the keys `arch`, `build_type`, `compiler`, `compiler.cppstd`, `compiler.libcxx`, `compiler.version`, `os`:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/
conan install . --build=missing -s:a build_type=Release -s:a compiler=gcc
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

To apply Conan dependency as a CMake Dependency Provider, clone this Git repository and then run the next command:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/cmake-conan
git clone https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan.git build/cmake-conan
```

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES=./build/cmake-conan/conan_provider.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

### Installing

In the build directory, run `cmake --install .` to install the software into `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`. If no prefix is
given, it will install system-wide. To change this, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/to` to your cmake
invocation.

### Building the Conan package

In the directory containing `conanfile.py`, run:

```bash
rm -rf ./build
conan build .
conan export-pkg .
```

The command `conan export-pkg .` also runs this test:

```bash
conan test test_package stores/0.0.1
```

Or run this command that includes the other stages to create the package:

```bash
conan create .
```
