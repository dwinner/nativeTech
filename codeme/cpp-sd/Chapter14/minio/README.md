Software Architecture with C++: Designing Robust C++ Systems with Modern Architectural Practices, Second Edition, published by Packt

## Chapter 14: Architecture of Distributed Systems

### Prerequisites

Install the following software:

- CMake 3.28
- Conan 2
- GCC 15, Clang 20, MSVC 19.50

The C++ compiler in your IDE and the Conan profile must be compatible to compile examples from the IDE.

Assuming you're on Linux or using WSL. The examples are developed on Linux, but their compilation and
functionality are also tested on macOS and Windows.

Configure a local Conan profile and remotes by running:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/
conan profile detect --name ./build/conan_profile
```

Make sure that the profile section `[settings]` contains:

```text
arch=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=15
os=Linux
```

### Building

**Important**: MinIO's dependency requires Python 3

To build the project, configure the Conan profile as described above, cd to its directory, and then run:

```bash
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./conan_profile -of .
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # build type must match Conan's
cmake --build .
```

If GCC 15 is not your default compiler, you can tell CMake to use it with the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flag:

```bash
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./conan_profile -of .
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which g++-15` # build type must match Conan's
cmake --build .
```

To pass the settings directly without a Conan profile, use the command line option `--settings:all` or `-s:a`, and the keys `arch`, `build_type`, `compiler`, `compiler.cppstd`, `compiler.libcxx`, `compiler.version`, `os`:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/ && mkdir build && cd build
conan install .. --build=missing -s:a build_type=Release -s:a compiler=gcc -of .
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # build type must match Conan's
cmake --build .
```

To apply Conan dependency as a CMake Dependency Provider, clone this Git repository and then run the next command:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/cmake-conan
git clone https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan.git build/cmake-conan
```

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES=./build/cmake-conan/conan_provider.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

### MinIO Console

The [MinIO Console](https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/administration/minio-console.html) is
a rich graphical user interface that supports browsing buckets and objects on your deployment.
You can explore the console by opening https://play.min.io:9443 in a browser. Log in with the following credentials:
