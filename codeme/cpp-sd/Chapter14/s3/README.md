Software Architecture with C++: Designing Robust C++ Systems with Modern Architectural Practices, Second Edition, published by Packt

## Chapter 14: Architecture of Distributed Systems

### Prerequisites

Install the following software:

- CMake 3.28
- Conan 2
- GCC 15, Clang 20, MSVC 19.50

The C++ compiler in your IDE and the Conan profile must be compatible to compile examples from the IDE.

Assuming you're on Linux or using WSL. The examples are developed on Linux, but their compilation and
functionality are also tested on macOS and Windows.

Configure a local Conan profile and remotes by running:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/
conan profile detect --name ./build/conan_profile
```

Make sure that the profile section `[settings]` contains:

```text
arch=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.cppstd=gnu20
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=15
os=Linux
```

Or

```text
arch=x86_64
build_type=Release
compiler=clang
compiler.cppstd=gnu20
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=20
os=Linux
```

### Building

**Important**: AWS SDK for C++ requires development libraries out of Conan packages

To build the project, configure the Conan profile as described above, cd to its directory, and then run:

```bash
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./conan_profile -of .
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # build type must match Conan's
cmake --build .
```

If GCC 15 is not your default compiler, you can tell CMake to use it with the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flag:

```bash
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./conan_profile -of .
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which g++-15` # build type must match Conan's
cmake --build .
```

To pass the settings directly without a Conan profile, use the command line option `--settings:all` or `-s:a`, and the keys `arch`, `build_type`, `compiler`, `compiler.cppstd`, `compiler.libcxx`, `compiler.version`, `os`:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/ && mkdir build && cd build
conan install .. --build=missing -s:a build_type=Release -s:a compiler=gcc -of .
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # build type must match Conan's
cmake --build .
```

To apply Conan dependency as a CMake Dependency Provider, clone this Git repository and then run the next command:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/cmake-conan
git clone https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan.git build/cmake-conan
```

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES=./build/cmake-conan/conan_provider.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

### Running the example application

You need valid AWS credentials for the program to run successfully.

Get your credentials by following this document:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AdministratorAccess.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-static-credentials.html

If you are creating a new user just for testing, you can attach the
`AdministratorAccess` policy to the created user. For production use, apply
fine-grained permissions.

Set the environment variables to the values you got from IAM using:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
```

If you are using Direnv, you can also put these variables to your `.env` file in
the current directory. Fill in your secret values in the `env.example` file and
rename it to `.env`.

The application creates an S3 bucket in AWS.

**Important**: Make sure to delete the bucket after testing, or you may be billed by the AWS. You can check the S3 bucket at
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=eu-central-1# (switch the region accordingly with the one in the code).

### Troubleshooting

The aws-sdk-cpp library transitively depends on m4/1.4.19 library, which may be incompatible with GCC,
so try Clang (chosen simultaneously in Conan and IDE).

Conan can determine current C and C++ compilers from the CC and CXX environment variables. For instance, these command rewrites the default profile:

```bash
CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ conan profile detect --force
```
