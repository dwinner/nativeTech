# Software Architecture with C++, Second Edition

Software Architecture with C++: Designing Robust C++ Systems with Modern Architectural Practices, Second Edition, published by Packt

## Chapter 8: Package Management

### Prerequisites

Install the following software:

- CMake 3.28
- Conan 2
- GCC 15, Clang 20, MSVC 19.50

For optional packaging with CPack:

- dpkg build tools: [dh_make](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/dh_make.8.html) and [dpkg-buildpackage](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/dpkg-buildpackage.1.html) to assemble DEB packages
- rpm build tools: [rpmbuild](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/rpmbuild.8.html) to assemble RPM packages

The C++ compiler in your IDE and the Conan profile must be compatible to compile examples from the IDE.

Assuming you're on Linux or using WSL. The examples are developed on Linux, but their compilation and
functionality are also tested on macOS and Windows.

Configure a local Conan profile and remotes by running:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/
conan profile detect --name ./build/conan_profile
```

Make sure that the profile section `[settings]` contains:

```text
arch=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
compiler.version=15
os=Linux
```

### Building

To build the project, configure the Conan profile as described above, cd to its directory, and then run:

```bash
conan install . --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./build/conan_profile
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

If GCC 15 is not your default compiler, you can tell CMake to use it with the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flag:

```bash
conan install . --build=missing -s build_type=Release -pr:a=./build/conan_profile
cmake --preset conan-release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which g++-15`
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

To pass the settings directly without a Conan profile, use the command line option `--settings:all` or `-s:a`, and the keys `arch`, `build_type`, `compiler`, `compiler.cppstd`, `compiler.libcxx`, `compiler.version`, `os`:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/
conan install . --build=missing -s:a build_type=Release -s:a compiler=gcc
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

To apply Conan dependency as a CMake Dependency Provider, clone this Git repository and then run the next command:

```bash
rm -rf ./build/cmake-conan
git clone https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan.git build/cmake-conan
```

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES=./build/cmake-conan/conan_provider.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

### Testing

To run tests from each of the projects, cd into their respective build directory, and then simply run `ctest`.

### Installing

In the build directory, run `cmake --install .` to install the software into `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`. If no prefix is
given, it will install system-wide. To change this, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/to` to your cmake
invocation.

### Packaging

In the build directory, run `cpack`. Simple as that. Assuming you're running on a system supporting DEB and RPM packages,
you'll get a .tar.gz file, a .zip file, a .deb and .rpm packages.

### Troubleshooting

Windows Firewall can block connections to the IP address 0.0.0.0 therefore set 127.0.0.1 in customer/src/customer/main.cpp
as a workaround or allow connections to that address on the host.

### Building the Conan package

In the directory containing `conanfile.py`, run:

```bash
rm -rf ./build
conan install . --build=missing
conan build .
conan export-pkg .
```

The command `conan export-pkg .` also runs this test:

```bash
conan test test_package customer/0.0.1
```

Or run this command that includes the other stages to create the package:

```bash
conan create . --build=missing
```

### Uploading the Conan package

[Run Artifactory CE](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/conan_repositories/setting_up_conan_remotes/artifactory/artifactory_ce_cpp.html)
using Docker Compose and wait because the server takes a while to start:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```

Open the URL http://localhost:8081 in a browser. The default user and password are `admin:password`.
Navigate to `Administration -> Repositories`, then click on the `Create a Repository` button, select `Local` and the Package Type `Conan`.
For example, type `conan-local` in the `Repository key` and click on `Create Local Repository`.

Connect the Conan remote repository:

```bash
conan remote add hinrg-tapps http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/conan/conan-local
```

Configure the credentials for the remote. By default, they are `admin:password`:

```bash
conan remote login hinrg-tapps admin -p password
```

Upload the built customer package:

```bash
conan upload customer -r=hinrg-tapps
```

Search for the customer package:

```bash
conan search "*" -r=hinrg-tapps
```

Navigate to either `Application -> Artifacts` or `Application -> Packages` (wait for package processing).
