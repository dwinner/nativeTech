This task requires you to add mutable `setter` methods `&mut self` for each field (title, description, status) of the `Ticket` struct. 
You must also ensure these setters enforce the same validation rules as the `Ticket::new` function. 
As suggested by the `TODO` comment, consider refactoring the validation logic into reusable private functions or static methods.
