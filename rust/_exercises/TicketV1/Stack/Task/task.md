This task requires you to determine the stack size in bytes for various primitive Rust types. 
You'll need to replace the `TODO` placeholders with the correct byte size for `u16`, `i32`, and `bool`, based on your understanding of Rust's data types. 
The `std::mem::size_of` function is used in the tests to verify these sizes.
