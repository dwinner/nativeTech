Welcome to the JetBrains Academy adaptation of the exciting [100 Exercises To Learn Rust](https://rust-exercises.com/100-exercises/01_intro/00_welcome.html) course.

This course will teach you Rust's core concepts, one exercise at a time.
You'll learn about Rust's syntax, its type system, its standard library, and its ecosystem.

The original materials were written by [Luca Palmieri](https://www.lpalmieri.com/). 
The essence of the original task remains, but we've spiced it up with contextual Rust development hints appearing directly in your IDE. This means you get timely assistance as you work through the code.
