## Editor

The <b>Editor</b> is your playground where you will be programming. You can experiment here while you work on the theoretical tasks and quizzes without being checked.

For programming assignments, the Editor is where youâ€™ll fix the existing code or write your own code from scratch. This code will be checked.

<style>
img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
</style>
<img src="editor.png" class="center" width="100%"/>


To run your code at any time, if there is no `main` method, go to `/tests` directory choose the Run option from the context menu or press <span style="color: #509DD6">&shortcut:Run;</span>:

<img src="run-program.png" class="center" width="100%"/>

Another way to check code for particular task is to click on `Check` button below task description.

It can sometimes be helpful to run the `main()` function (contained in the `main.rs` file, however note that not all the tasks have it) to see what output your code produces.
If you want to go back to the Editor and focus on your code, the fastest way to do it is with the Hide All Windows command (<span style="color: #509DD6">&shortcut:HideAllWindows;</span>). To get all the windows back, repeat the command.
