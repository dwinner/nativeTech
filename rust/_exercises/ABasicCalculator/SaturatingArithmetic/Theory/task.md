## `saturating_` methods
##

You can opt into **saturating arithmetic** by using the `saturating_` methods[^method].\
Instead of wrapping around, saturating arithmetic will return the maximum or minimum value for the integer type.
For example:

```rust
let x = 255u8;
let y = 1u8;
let sum = x.saturating_add(y);
assert_eq!(sum, 255);
```

Since `255 + 1` is `256`, which is bigger than `u8::MAX`, the result is `u8::MAX` (255).\
The opposite happens for underflows: `0 - 1` is `-1`, which is smaller than `u8::MIN`, so the result is `u8::MIN` (0).

You can't get saturating arithmetic via the `overflow-checks` profile settingâ€”you have to explicitly opt into it
when performing the arithmetic operation.

[^method]: You can think of methods as functions that are "attached" to a specific type.
We'll cover methods (and how to define them) in the next chapter.
