// Define a function named `factorial` that, given a non-negative integer `n`,
// returns `n!`, the factorial of `n`.
//
// The factorial of `n` is defined as the product of all positive integers up to `n`.
// For example, `5!` (read "five factorial") is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`, which is `120`.
// `0!` is defined to be `1`.
//
// We expect `factorial(0)` to return `1`, `factorial(1)` to return `1`,
// `factorial(2)` to return `2`, and so on.
//
// Use only what you learned! No loops yet, so you'll have to use recursion!
