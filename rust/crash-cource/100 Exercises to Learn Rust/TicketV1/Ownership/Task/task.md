This task requires you to refactor the accessor methods (`title`, `description`, `status`) of the `Ticket` struct. 
Your goal is to change their signatures so they take an immutable reference to self `&self` as an argument, rather than taking ownership. 
All instructions are detailed in the `TODO` comment within the code.
