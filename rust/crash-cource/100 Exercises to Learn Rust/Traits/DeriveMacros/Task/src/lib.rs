// TODO: A (derivable) trait implementation is missing for this exercise to compile successfully.
//   Fix it!
//
// # `Debug` primer
//
// `Debug` returns a representation of a Rust type that's suitable for debugging (hence the name).
// `assert_eq!` requires `Ticket` to implement `Debug` because, when the assertion fails, it tries to
// print both sides of the comparison to the terminal.
// If the compared type doesn't implement `Debug`, it doesn't know how to represent them!

    title: String,

    status: String,

    pub fn new(title: String, description: String, status: String) -> Ticket {
