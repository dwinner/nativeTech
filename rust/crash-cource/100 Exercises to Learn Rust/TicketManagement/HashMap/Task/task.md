This task is to replace all todo!() macros in the `TicketStore` implementation. This includes initializing the `HashMap` in `new`, correctly adding tickets, and implementing `get` and `get_mut` methods. You'll also need to implement any additional traits on `TicketId` required for `HashMap` keys.

Check all `TODO` comments for specific locations.
